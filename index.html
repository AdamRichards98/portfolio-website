        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Adam Richards, a Computer Science student at the University of Kansas. I am currently focusing on software engineering and systems development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary programming experience is with C, C++, and Python, while I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. I've worked with languages and technologies like SQL, Haskell, PHP, Ruby, and Java — and I enjoy expanding my toolkit as often as possible.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Academically, I've studied or am currently exploring topics such as embedded systems, computer architecture, machine learning, operating systems, and database systems. I strive to be a well-rounded developer, and I believe having a broad technical foundation is key to solving real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of programming, I enjoy 3D printing — whether it’s functional hardware or custom pieces for tabletop games. I’m an avid board game and tabletop gaming enthusiast.
